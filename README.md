# streamlit

<p>This is an implementation of the dropdown widget for the tips dataset that I created on Jupyter NB using streamlit.</p>

<p><a href="https://cjschan-streamlit-tips-plots-9dqxk2.streamlitapp.com/">Open in streamlit</a></p>

<p>pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run tips_plots.py
</p>

<p>Note: There's currently a bug in python 3.9 that causes some issues with streamlit 1.12, so I used streamlit 1.11.</p>
